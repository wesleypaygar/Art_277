Ref: Mr.Albert Momo University Application,
</h1><hr>Dear Mr.Momo,
<p> Thank you for your recent application to join us at the Starz University's science faculty to study as part of your PhD next year.I will answer your questions one by one , in the following sections.
<br><br>
<h2>Starting dates</h2><br><p>We are happy to accommodate you starting your study with us at anytime, however it would suit us better if you could starts at the beginning of a semester , the start dates of each one are as follows:<br><br> First semester :9 October 2022<br>Second semester:15 January 2023 Third Semester:2 May 2023<br>
<p>Please let me know if this is ok,if so which date is prefer.<br><p> You can find more information about important University dates on our website.<br><em> <h3>Subjects of study</h3></em></b><br>
<p> At the Starz University,we have pretty open minded research facility___as long as the subjects fall somewhere in the realm of science and technology.You seem as an intelligent , dedicated, researcher, and just kind of  person we'd like to have on our team. saying that, of the ideas you summited we were most intrigued by are as follows: in order of priority: <p>Turning<big>H</big><sub>2</sub></big>O into wine , and the benefits of Resveratrol(H<sub>14</sub>H<sub>12</sub>0<sub>3</sub>4</sup>) measuring the effect on performance of funk bassplayers at temperature exceeding 30°C (86°F) when the audience size exponentially increase (effect 3x10<sup>3</sup> increasing to 3x10<sup>4) <br><p>HTML and CSS construct for representing  musical scores <br><p> So please can you provide more information on each of these subjects including how long you'd expect the research to take , required staff and other resources and anything else you think we'd need to know ?

 <p><b>Exotic dance moves</b></p> 
 <p>Yes you are right!as part of my doctorate work. I did study exotic tribal dances .To answer your question,my favorite dances are as follows, with definition </p>
<br> Polynesian Chicken Dance
<br><blockquote>A little known but very influential dance dating back as far as 300 BC, a whole village would dance around in circles like chickens to encourage their livestock to be "fruitful".</blockquote >
<br>Icelandic brownian shuffle
<br><blockquote> Before the Icelandic developed fire as their means of getting warm ,they used to practice this dance, which involved huddling close together in a circle on the floor, and shulffing their bodies in imperceptibly tiny , very rapid movements.One of my fellow students used to say that he thought this danve inspired morden style such as Twerking.</blockquote>
<br> Arctic Route dance
<br><blockquote> An interesting example of historic misinformation , English explorers in the 1960s believe to have discovered new dance style characterized by  "robotic" stilted movement, being practice by inhibtants of Northern Alaska and . later on however it was discovered that they were just moving like this because they really cold.</blockquote>

<p>Your Sincerely,
